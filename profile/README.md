Emotus is an innovative emotional wellness app designed to help users track their mood, understand emotional patterns, and receive personalized recommendations for improving their mental well-being. By using a combination of machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing, Emotus offers a comprehensive, data-driven solution for users looking to improve their emotional health. The app focuses on core emotional states such as anger, love, fear, joy, and sadness, providing tailored suggestions and visualizing emotional trends over time. The solution is designed to be culturally relevant, with a particular focus on the Indonesian audience, integrating tools like Sastrawi for text preprocessing and localized emotional recommendations.
