### **What is Emotus?**
<p align="justify">
Emotus is an innovative emotional wellness app designed to help users track their mood, understand emotional patterns, and receive personalized recommendations for improving their mental well-being. By using a combination of machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing, Emotus offers a comprehensive, data-driven solution for users looking to improve their emotional health. The app focuses on core emotional states such as anger, love, fear, joy, and sadness, providing tailored suggestions and visualizing emotional trends over time. The solution is designed to be culturally relevant, with a particular focus on the Indonesian audience, integrating tools like Sastrawi for text preprocessing and localized emotional recommendations.

### **How did we come up with this project?**
<p align="justify">
Our team recognized the growing importance of mental health and the need for accessible tools to support emotional well-being. Through discussions, we identified that while many people are aware of the importance of mental health, they often lack structured ways to monitor and understand their emotions. Inspired by this gap, we envisioned an application that simplifies mood tracking and provides actionable insights, empowering users to recognize emotional patterns and manage their mental health proactively. The idea resonated with our team‚Äôs shared goal to create a meaningful tool that could contribute to users' overall well-being.
